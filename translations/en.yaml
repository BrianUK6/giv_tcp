  SELF_RUN_LOOP_TIMER:
    name: Self Run Loop Timer
    description: >-
      How often should GivTCP connect to the inverter to check for data when self run is enabled? Default is 5, measured in seconds.
  HA_AUTO_D:
    name: Home Assistant Auto Discovery
    description: >-
      If this option and MQTT are enabled, GivTCP will publish Home Assistant Auto Discovery messages, which will allow Home Assistant to automagically create all entitites and devices to allow read and control of your Invertor. Leave this option enabled if you're not sure what that means.
